# Flow

A  mini game about Joined Together developed for GMTK Game Jam 2021, inspired by Craig Reynolds’ Boids Algorithm.

When developing this game, a friend happened to organize another small Game Jam, whose theme was "Cold and Warm", so I merged two themes and joined both sides by the way. Thanks to the bionics effect of the algorithm, I got  very wonderful movement curves.

The point to play this game is that when you heat the object which named the FLOW, it becomes more active (faster,redder, and stronger centripetal force). Part of this idea comes from the imagination of thermodynamics. And when more active FLOWs gather together, the power of the whole group will become stronger and then you can lead them to beat the enemies.

This is  the only sketch I have "finished" at the moment. As a sketch produced in 48 hours, I am personally a bit satisfied with its creativity and completion, but it is also a pity that I failed to realize more of my ideas for it in time.Maybe in the future there will be a chance to make better game mechanics based on it.

You can play it online at itch.io, or download it for a better playing experience.
